The program will load into a login screen.  Use the username: test and password: test. Alternatively, you may also use username: admin and password: admin.
Once logged in, the user will be taken to the appointment form. The top half is used for editing current appointments, the bottom half is used for adding new appointments.
The menu bar at the top labeled "customers" will provide the user the option to add/edit.
The menu bar at the top labeled "reports" will allow the user to view reports.

I have added the additional report to generate the number of appointments a contact has by month. This will allow the user to manage contact appointments appropriately.
